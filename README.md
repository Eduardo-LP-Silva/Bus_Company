# Bus_Company
This is a project developed during my first year in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP, more specifically in the 
Programming course. 
It is supposed to allow the management of a bus company, having in mind individual routes, buses, drivers and their schedules.

To use the application, the user first needs to specify the correct files (default lines file is "Linhas.txt" and drivers file
"Condutores.txt").
